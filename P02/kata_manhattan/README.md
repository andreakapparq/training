# Manhattan Kata

## Manhattan Distance

Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

## Step 1

Write a function int manhattanDistance(Point a, Point b) that returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

Point should be a class

## Step 2

Apply the following rules

The class Point is immutable (its state cannot be changed after instantiation)
The class Point has no Getters
The class Point has no public properties (i.e. the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).
